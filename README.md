# Databases
Faculty subject Databases.
## Content (Syllabus outline)
### Course topics
Introduction and motivation for database use and
explanation of basic concepts: database, data
independence, comparisons of databases and file
system data storage.  
Overview of software programs that support the usage
of database, focusing on database management systems
(DBMS), their functions and tasks they can perform.
Overview of generalized database architecture,
thorough explanation of data independence and user
views.  
Basic concepts of database management: user roles and
privileges, logical and physical space, logging and modes
of DBMS execution.  
Introduction to different data models that serve as a
theoretical foundation for data storage and operation:
network and hierarchical model, relational, object and
object-relational model.  
Thorough discussion of the relational data model.
Overview of its basic building blocks (relations,
attributes, keys) and operations (relational algebra and
calculus).  
Implementation of relational data model in relational
DBMS and its practical extensions. Query languages SQL
and QBE.  
Estimation of query complexity and its optimization.
Usage of indexes and triggers.
Basic concepts of database design. Normal forms and
benefits of their use.  
Concurrent database use and transactions.  
Different ways of accessing the data in databases.
Various client types, programmatic access. The role of
databases in Web applications.  
### Tutorial topics
Getting familiar with a chosen DBMS and provided data
access options.  
Learning to use the query language SQL thoroughly,
both in theory and in practice.  
1. the obtained knowledge for practical database
problem solving (homework and a non-trivial
project).  
  
Through tutorial students get familiar with the chosen
DMBS and the tools it provides, and use them - in
course of their project â€“ as a part of a practical problem
solution. The final part of the project is a written
presentation of the assigned problem, its solution and
results.
## Objectives and competences
The main course objective is to introduce the students
to principles of database management systems and
their various usages, and prepare them for autonomous
and efficient use of available tools, especially SQL.
