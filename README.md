# Databases
Faculty subject Databases.
## Content (Syllabus outline)
### Course topics
Introduction and motivation for database use and
explanation of basic concepts: database, data
independence, comparisons of databases and file
system data storage.  
Overview of software programs that support the usage
of database, focusing on database management systems
(DBMS), their functions and tasks they can perform.
Overview of generalized database architecture,
thorough explanation of data independence and user
views.  
Basic concepts of database management: user roles and
privileges, logical and physical space, logging and modes
of DBMS execution.  
Introduction to different data models that serve as a
theoretical foundation for data storage and operation:
network and hierarchical model, relational, object and
object-relational model.  
Thorough discussion of the relational data model.
Overview of its basic building blocks (relations,
attributes, keys) and operations (relational algebra and
calculus).  
Implementation of relational data model in relational
DBMS and its practical extensions. Query languages SQL
and QBE.  
Estimation of query complexity and its optimization.
Usage of indexes and triggers.
Basic concepts of database design. Normal forms and
benefits of their use.  
Concurrent database use and transactions.  
Different ways of accessing the data in databases.
Various client types, programmatic access. The role of
databases in Web applications.  
### Tutorial topics
Getting familiar with a chosen DBMS and provided data
access options.  
Learning to use the query language SQL thoroughly,
both in theory and in practice.  
1. the obtained knowledge for practical database
problem solving (homework and a non-trivial
project).  
  
Through tutorial students get familiar with the chosen
DMBS and the tools it provides, and use them - in
course of their project – as a part of a practical problem
solution. The final part of the project is a written
presentation of the assigned problem, its solution and
results.
## Objectives and competences
The main course objective is to introduce the students
to principles of database management systems and
their various usages, and prepare them for autonomous
and efficient use of available tools, especially SQL.
### General competences

thinking
- the ability to define, understand and solve creative
professional challenges in computer and
information science;
- compliance with security, functional, economic and
environmental principles
- the ability to apply acquired knowledge in
independent work for solving technical and
scientific problems in computer and information
science; the ability to upgrade acquired knowledge
### Subject specific competences
basic skills in computer and information science, which
includes basic theoretical skills, practical knowledge and
skills essential for the field of computer and information
science.
- practical knowledge and skills of computer
hardware, software and information technology
necessary for successful professional work in
computer and information science
- the ability to independently perform both less
demanding and complex engineering and
organisational tasks in certain narrow areas and 
independently solve specific well-defined tasks in
computer and information science
## Intended learning outcomes

Introduction and comprehension of interactions
between theoretical principles (especially those of
relational data model) and their practical use in modern
databases.
### Transferable skills
Data storage in databases and their use are basic
transferrable skills, useful in virtually all fields of
computer science.
